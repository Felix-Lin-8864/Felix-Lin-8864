## Hi ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€

I'm Felix Lin, a third year CS student at UNSW. 

Currently, I am working on a Terraria/tModLoader mod in C#! Many of my projects are game-related (or are games), as I find them fun and interesting to develop, but I also have a few non-game-related projects which I found equally enjoyable to create.
