## Hola Amigos ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€

I'm Felix Lin, a third year CS student at UNSW. 

In case you couldn't tell from the ðŸ¦€s, I like Rust! However, many codebases don't use Rust (unfortunately, though fair due to conversion costs, refactoring and buid times) so I somewhat treat it as a hobby language I use in some of my projects. Currently, I am working on a Terraria/tModLoader mod in C# (also learning C# to do so, but I know C as well)! Many of my projects are game-related (or are games), as I find them fun to develop (sidenote: I am horrible at games), but I also have a few non-game-related projects which I found equally enjoyable to create!

I won't say too much more, since you can read more about me at my portfolio on gh-pages [here ðŸ¦€](https://felix-lin-8864.github.io/)!
